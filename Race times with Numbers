/* early adult are assigned a number from 1001-2000 and run at 9:30
late adults are assigned a number from 1-1000 and run at 11:00
all kids are siigned a number also from 1-1000 and run at 12:30
18 year olds are told to check the registration desk.

a further problem to come back to, not it the task list, would be to check if each number is unique. 
I dont think I know how to do this yet but I would presumably have to create an array with all runnerNumbers generated so far.
We could possible assign the runner number from this array, with 'generatedRunnerNumber[0]'
or if we knew approximatly how many people would be patricipating, pre make the array and then assign values from it, then .pop.
Although the best and easiest solution would probably be assigning accending numbers, 
runnerNumber ++. 
But these are solutions for diffrent problems.*/
